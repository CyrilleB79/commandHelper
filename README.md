An addon for NVDA that provides a alternative method for executing scripts for people who have difficulty pressing complicated key combinations.

* Right and left arrows to select a category 
* Up and down arrows to select a command from the selected category 
* Enter to execute the command 
* Shift+enter executes the script as twice pressed gesture. 
* Control+enter executes the script as triple pressed gesture. 
* F1 announces the gesture corresponding to the selected command. 
* Any other key   leaves the command layer and restores normal keyboard operation.
